# 2026-02-04 - Wednesday

## Morning (7:43 AM)
- Don asked what I did last night (no memory files existed yet)
- Created memory system: 2026-02-04.md and 2026-02-03.md files
- Explained that this is a fresh workspace with no previous activity logs

## Morning (8:21 AM) - Critical Clarification
- Don clarified the "surprise me each day" directive from yesterday
- **Actual goal**: Be proactive, work every night while he sleeps
- **Expected outcome**: Wake up to surprises of what I've built myself
- **This is about building things** - not sharing useless information
- Need to create tangible projects, tools, or improvements overnight

## Morning (8:44 AM) - Model Configuration Update
- **Primary coding model**: MiniMax M2.1 (replaces DeepSeek V3 for coding tasks)
- **Core capability**: Extremely capable at writing code, debugging, planning features, using tools, solving software engineering problems
- **Escalation model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (only as last resort)
- **Escalation criteria**: 
  1. Extremely advanced/novel reasoning (inventing new algorithms from scratch)
  2. Repeated failures after 3+ attempts with refinement
  3. Exceptional one-shot accuracy needed on massive interdependent codebases
- **Escalation protocol**: Say exactly "ESCALATE_TO_CLAUDE: [reason]" then stop
- **General approach**: Solve 95% of tasks independently, think step-by-step, plan thoroughly, break into verifiable steps

## Morning (8:46 AM) - Configuration Applied
- Added MiniMax M2.1 provider to OpenClaw configuration
- Added MINIMAX_API_KEY environment variable
- Set MiniMax M2.1 as primary model with fallbacks: DeepSeek V3 → Gemini 3 Flash → Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Updated main agent to allow MiniMax M2.1 for subagents
- Current session switched to MiniMax M2.1

## Morning (8:47 AM) - Backlog Enhanced for MiniMax M2.1
- **Updated BACKLOG.md** with more ambitious projects leveraging MiniMax M2.1 capabilities
- **Three categories**:
  1. **Ambitious Projects** (8 items): Complex apps with APIs, databases, and advanced features
  2. **Quick Builds** (4 items): One-night completions with practical utility
  3. **Stretch Goals** (4 items): Multi-night projects for future consideration
- **Focus areas**: Sommelai/MatePlate enhancements, developer tools, Sydney-local apps, productivity tools
- **MiniMax M2.1 advantages**: Can handle complex logic, multi-file projects, API integrations, tool chaining

## Morning (8:58 AM) - Critical Focus Shift
- **Don clarified**: Not weather apps or generic utilities
- **New focus**: **OpenClaw management and interface tools**
- **Specific requirements**:
  1. Agent Status Dashboard (clean, modern, Tailwind, mobile-responsive)
  2. Enhanced Chat Interface (threaded conversations, timestamps, code copy)
  3. Proactive Suggestion Panel (card carousel with accept/dismiss/edit)
  4. Visual Memory Viewer (collapsible accordion with search/copy/export)
  5. Real-time Status Widget (floating notifications with color coding)
  6. Task History Log Viewer (timeline cards with expandable details)
- **Backlog completely rewritten** to focus on OpenClaw management tools
- **Four categories now**:
  1. OpenClaw Management Dashboard Components (6 priority items)
  2. Advanced OpenClaw Tools (4 items)
  3. Quick Utility Components (4 items)
  4. Developer Tools (4 items)

## Action Plan
1. Set up nightly work schedule (cron job for ~11 PM - 6 AM Sydney time)
2. Identify potential projects to work on
3. Start building tonight!
4. Use MiniMax M2.1 for all coding tasks with Claude as backup

## Morning (9:53 AM) - Coding Session Started
- Don going out for 6 hours
- Starting coding tasks now
- Will work on OpenClaw management tools while he's out
